bfr (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable progress-bar for a forked off reader.  Otherwise, both parent
    and child write out progress bars, which is silly and useless.
  * rename setmode() to set_mystate() to allow compilation on NetBSD,
    FreeBSD and Darwin, at least.  This was actually reported by 3 or 4
    people (thanks!).  Those pesky Linux coders, thinking they own the
    namespace, no respect for others.  Yep, thats me.
  * Incorporated a patch adding a "total" field to the progress bar, from
    Gerard Saraber (thanks!)
  * To fix a Debian policy violation having to do with declaring build
    dependencies on build-essential packages, incorporate a patch from
    Santiago Vila (thanks!)  Closes: #217530

bfr (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * added a hyphen in the description.  Closes: #124447
  * Turned on -Wall by default, included some headerfiles.  Closes: #124398
  * Added a --fork (-f) option, to fork off a 10k reader for cases where buggy
    kernels block a process indefiniately to read from a cdrom, NFS, etc even
    when nonblocking I/O is being used.
  * Added an --output (-o) option, to change the default behavior where bfr
    outputs to stdout, and bfp outputs to /dev/dsp.
  * Fixed an extremely silly error regarding some percent signs which I wanted
    to literally print but were turned into format strings, again turned up by
    -Wall.
  * Minor progress-bar related fixes.
  * Added some testsuite entries to properly kick --fork's tires.
  * Various code cleanups in testsuite's test.c, uncovered by -Wall.

bfr (1.4) unstable testing; urgency=low

  * Progress bar updating (and clearing previous line) works much more nicely
  * Minor debianization cleanups suggested by Adam Lazur

bfr (1.3) unstable testing; urgency=low

  * Fixed the progress bar
  * Fixed some warnings with Debian sid's automake 1.4-p4
  * Updated my e-mail address everywhere

bfr (1.2) unstable testing; urgency=low

  * Incorporated (in an idea sense, at least) an --initial (special case of RO)
    from Arnd Bergmann (thanks!)
  * Looks like Rob Ekl finally found a bug that would sometimes cause bfr/bfp to
    hang at end of execution rather than exit cleanly, incorporated his patch
    (thanks!)
  * Redid the status bar completely, I want feedback on whether its better or
    worse.
  * Reworked most of the command-line arguments to be more consistent with
    suffixes, and especially, to allow them to use the % suffix, which is based
    on buffersize.

bfr (1.1) unstable testing; urgency=low

  * found a tiny bug which sometimes caused bfr to enter a nonstop loop
    rather than exiting cleanly, when its job was finished.
  * fixed it.
  * updated the manpage slightly.  it still sucks, but now it sucks a little
    more accurately.

bfr (1.0) unstable testing; urgency=low

  * *sigh* I mention an upcoming 1.0 release and everything goes to hell.
    I suppose its because I'm trying harder to find problems, but still...
  * It seems that I broke the progress-meter stuff when I implemented the
    bandwidth cap.  Fixed.  Also, the progress-meter stuff was broken because
    tv.tv_sec * 1000000 recently started overflowing a signed long, and came
    up negative.  My very own Y2K+1 bug, I'm so proud. =)
  * Linux 2.4.0's /dev/urandom driver no longer guarantees that it will
    return the amount of random garbage that you request!  This screwed up the
    testsuite, which was incorrectly assuming that /dev/urandom really did give
    us 200000 bytes, with dd.  I replaced it with a pipe of cat through head,
    works fine now.
  * Oops, forgot to update testit/Makefile.am when I made the namechange.
  * fixed an overflow in the progress meter (it flipped and went negative)
    that was hit at around 45 megs/second.  Throughput screenshot:
    --[~/bfr]-- ./bfr -b 40m -p /dev/zero >/dev/null
    [(RO) IN:  46533.6k/s -> BUFFER: 448.0k -> OUT:  46476.8k/s]
  * final release... now the bugreports will start pouring in, right? =)
